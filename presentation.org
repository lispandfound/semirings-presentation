* Abstract                                                         :noexport:
What do Google Maps, a jewellery thief, and Fibonacci of Pisa have in common? Learn how a humble algebraic structure and an esoteric programming language come together to find routes between restaurants, efficiently steal diamonds, and solve recurrence relations. Along the way, we'll learn how to compute with infinity and redefine our understanding of linearity.
* What is this Presentation About?
1. The superpowers of /closed semirings/.
2. Why being /lazy/ is better than being /strict/.

- This talk follows a paper of Stephen Dolan (2013) /Fun with semirings: a functional pearl on the abuse of linear algebra/, ACM.

* Semirings
A semiring \((S, \cdot, + )\) is a set with two binary operations \(\cdot\) and \(+\) such that:
1. Addition \(+\) in \(S\) is closed, commutative, and associative, with identity \(0\)
   - Notice :: No inverses!
2. Multplication \(\cdot\) in \(S\) is closed and associative with identity \(1\)
3. Multplication distributes into addition in the usual fashion.
4. Annilhation: \(0 \cdot x = 0 = x \cdot 0\).
* Semirings; TLDR
A semiring is a ring where you might not be able to undo addition.
* Semirings: Examples
- Any ring.
- The natural numbers (if you include zero) with the usual addition and multiplication.
- The /tropical/ semiring \emoji{desert-island}.

  - ...which is the set \(\mathbb{R}^{+ }\cup\{\infty\}\) with the addition operator \(\mathrm{min}\) and the multiplication operator \(+\).
  - the identity of \(\mathrm{min}\) is \(\infty\) and the identity of \(+\) is zero.
- If \(S\) is a semiring, then \(M_n(S)\) is also a semiring.
* Closed Semirings
- A /closed semiring/ has a /closure/ operator \(\ast\) satisfying
  #+begin_equation
  a^{\ast} = 1 + aa^{\ast}
  #+end_equation
- Informally: \(a^\ast = 1 + a + a^2 + a^3 + ...\)
- In the reals, \(a^\ast = 1 / (1 - a)\).
* Closed Semirings and Linear Equations
- The closure operator lets us solve the equation \(x = ax + b\).
  #+BEGIN_equation
  a(a^{\ast} b) + b = (a^{\ast} a + 1) b = a^{\ast} b.
  #+END_equation
- It is the fixpoint of the affine map.  
* Closed Semirings and Linear Equations
**                                                            :B_theorem:

:END:
Let \(S\) be a closed semiring. Then \(M_n(S)\) is also a closed semiring. 
* Closed Semirings and Linear Equations
- The algorithm to compute the closure \(M^{\ast}\) is a recursive.
- The closure of \(M\) satisfies \(M^\ast = A M^\ast + B\).
* Haskell
Haskell is programming language that is...
- *Lazy*. Haskell will not evaluate expressions until required.
- *Strongly-Typed*. requires all values to have a type.
- *Functional*. core primitive in Haskell is /functional composition/.
* Laziness

* Shortest Paths
- In a weighted graph \(G\) we would like to know the shortest distance between any two vertices.
- Ideally given a graph \(G\), we would output a matrix \(M\) such that \(M_{i, j}\) is the shortest distance between vertex \(i\) and vertex \(j\).
* Shortest Path Algorithm
- Let \(M\) be the \(n \times n\) adjacency matrix of \(G\) with \(n\) vertices, where \(M_{i, j} = \infty\) if vertex \(i\) is not adjacent to vertex \(j\).
- In the tropical semiring: \(M^2_{i, j} = \mathrm{min}_{1 \leq k \leq n} M_{i, k} + M_{j, k}\).
- \(M^k_{i, j}\) is the shortest length \(k\) path in \(G\) between \(i\) and \(j\) in \(G\).
* Shortest Path Algorithm
- The shortest path matrix \(D\) would be then the component-wise minimum of \(M^k\) over all \(k\).
- Alternatively, you could think of this as the fixpoint of the iterative process \(X \mapsto M X + M\).
- This is precisely \(M^\ast\)!
* Some Haskell Code
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
  shortestPath :: Matrix ExReal -> Matrix ExReal
  shortestPath = closure

* Formal Semiring Power Series
- We can map sequences \(\{a_i\}_{i =1}^\infty\) to /formal power series/ \(a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots\).
- Here \(x\) is an abstract symbol, we cannot evaluate it!
- Addition is componenent-wise.
* Formal Semiring Power Series
- Multiplying \(a_0 + a_1 x + a_2 x^2 + \cdots\) and \(b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x^2 + \cdots\) gives \(c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + \cdots\) where
  - \(c_i = \sum_{j + k = i} a_j b_k\)
- Multiplying by \(x\) shifts the sequence along one.
* Formal Semiring Power Series
- Given a closed semiring \(S\), the set of formal power series \(S[ [x]]\) form a semiring.
- The closure of \(a + px\) is \(s^\ast\), where \(s^\ast = a^\ast(1 + p s^\ast)\).
* Semiring Power Series in Haskell
#+begin_src haskell
  instance Semiring s => Semiring [s] where
    one = [one] 
    zero = []
    (+.) x y = zipWith (+.) x y
    (*.) [] _ = []
    (*.) _ [] = []
    (*.) (a:p) (b:q) = ...
    closure [] = one
    closure (a:p) = r
      where r = (closure a) *. (one +. p *. r)
      --    r =  a*            (1   +  p r)
  #+end_src
* Solving Linear Recurrence Relations
- Formal power series semirings solve every linear recurrence relation.
- The Fibonacci sequence \(F\) expressed as a power series satsisfies \(F = 1 + (x + x^2) F\).
- Because \(F\) is a fixed point, its solution is expressed as a closure: \(F = (x + x^2)^\ast\).
* In Haskell
#+begin_src haskell
  --                  0 + x + x^2
  fibonacci = closure [0, 1, 1]

  take 10 fibonacci -- [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ...]
#+end_src
* Addendum
Semirings are applied in other ways not listed here:
- Reachability in a graph
- DFA to regular expression conversion
- Dataflow analysis (finding unused variables in code)
- Most dynamic programming problems (think 0/1 knapsack, edit distance between strings, etcâ€¦)
- Generalising Gaussian eliminitation.
* Mathematics and Haskell
Mathematics inspires Haskell:
- Classic algebraic structures have typeclasses in Haskell.
  - e.g. Semigroups and Monoids.
- Category Theory too!
  - e.g. Functors, Monads, Morphisms.
- Laziness and purity lets us think of equality in the usual sense.
  - There are programs that can auto-refactor based on properties from Mathematics.
